# 🦊 FurrDB

**FurrDB** is a minimal, Redis-inspired in-memory key-value store written in pure Go.

![Cover](./cover.png)

- **Persistent disk storage**
- **Built-in script registration and execution (by hash)**
- **Simple custom command protocol over TCP**
- **No external libraries or dependencies**

> Designed to be lightweight, scriptable, and fast — without the bulk of Redis.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### 1. Core Components

#### 📦 `db/` - In-Memory Store
- Simple `map[string]string` store
- Thread-safe operations
- Dispatches commands based on input tokens

#### 💾 `engine/` - Persistence Engine
- Append-Only File (AOF) log of all write commands
- Loads AOF on startup to recover state
- Periodic flush support

#### 🌐 `server/` - TCP Protocol Handler
- Accepts client connections on a configurable port
- Parses line-based commands, e.g.:
  ```
  SET key value
  GET key
  DEL key
  ```
- Routes commands to `db` package

#### 📜 `script/` - Script Manager
- Accepts scripts (as text)
- Stores in-memory with a SHA256 hash key
- Can run stored scripts by hash with arguments
- Scripts can access DB via pre-defined keywords and syntax

#### 👨‍💻 `client/` - CLI Tool
- Connects to the server via TCP
- Allows running commands from terminal or scripts

#### 💬 `repl/` - Local Shell (Optional)
- Runs DB commands directly against in-process store
- Debugging/testing without networking

| `INFO`          | Show server info/stats                      |
| `PING`          | Responds with `PONG`                        |
| `REGSCRIPT s`   | Register script `s`, returns hash           |
| `RUNSCRIPT h`   | Run registered script by hash               |

### 📝 Command Examples

#### String
```
SET foo bar
GET foo
DEL foo
EXISTS foo
```

#### List
```
LPUSH mylist a b
RPUSH mylist c
t# mylist is now [b, a, c]
LPOP mylist   # returns b
RPOP mylist   # returns c
LRANGE mylist 0 1  # returns a
```

#### Set
```
SADD myset x y z
SMEMBERS myset   # returns x,y,z
SREM myset y
SMEMBERS myset   # returns x,z
```

#### Meta
```
KEYS        # returns all keys
FLUSHDB     # clears the database
INFO        # returns keys:<count>
```

## 🔐 Scripts

FurrDB supports a **basic script runner**.

- Register a script:
  ```
  REGSCRIPT SET foo bar; GET foo
  ```
- Run it by hash:
  ```
  RUNSCRIPT <hash>
  ```

Script engine features:
- Line-by-line command interpretation
- Sequential execution
- Shared context with DB store

---

## 💾 Persistence

- All write commands (`SET`, `DEL`, etc.) are logged to an `aof.log`
- On startup, this file is replayed to reconstruct the state
- Scripts and their hashes are also persisted

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Build Server

```bash
go build -o furrdb ./cmd/furrdb
```

### Run Server

```bash
./furrdb
```
Server runs on `localhost:7070` by default.

### Use Client

```bash
go run ./client
```
Or connect manually:
```bash
telnet localhost 7070
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Config      | Default      |
|-------------|--------------|
| Host        | localhost    |
| Port        | 7070         |
| AOF Path    | aof.log      |
| Script File | scripts.db   |

Defaults are hardcoded for simplicity.  
Future config may support `.env` or flags.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests can be added to each module (`*_test.go`)
- Example scripts: `scripts/`
- Test data: `testdata/`

---

## 🧱 Implementation Details

- Uses only standard library packages
- No goroutines in DB logic (all connections are handled via one goroutine per client)
- Simple TCP text protocol (space-delimited tokens)
- Commands are dispatched via a map of handlers

---

## 🔄 Planned Extensions

- TTL/Expiration logic for keys
- Lua or custom mini-scripting language with memory sandbox
- Pub/Sub channels
- Clustering (gossip or Raft)
- Optional binary protocol
